# Behind the Screen

With scikit-learn’s `DecisionTreeRegressor`, our project predicts the employee burnout on a scale from 0-1 given three features: seniority in their respective institution on a scale from 0-5, the amount of resources allocated to the employee to work (i.e. number of working hours) on a scale from 1-10, and a self-reported mental fatigue score on a scale from 0-10.

Special thanks to HackerEarth, `“Are Your Employees Burning Out?” Kaggle, 2020, doi: 10.34740/KAGGLE/DS/949779` for the dataset.
